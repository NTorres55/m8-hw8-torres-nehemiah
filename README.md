## Issues I had:
1. I had quite a bit of difficulty figuring out how to transition with CSS for a dropdown menu (without referencing recordings). I had seen it before, thought I had done one before, so I attempted to play with it and get a transition on hover for the submenu while also having hover fade in/out for background color, etc. When I was done with this assignment, I realized I hadn't done any JS. I will play around with it more and try it out with JS.

## Outside sources I used:
1. I referenced 2 w3schools.com pages to help out in my experimenting - [CSS Transitions](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp) and [Transition on Hover](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_transition_hover.asp). 
2. I also referenced a few forums like CSS-Tricks and Stackoverflow to help with troubleshooting.
